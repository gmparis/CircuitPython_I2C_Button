CircuitPython I2C Button Ã  la Sparkfun Qwiic Button/Switch/Arcade


Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_
or individual libraries can be installed using
`circup <https://github.com/adafruit/circup>`_.

Installing to a Connected CircuitPython Device with Circup
==========================================================

Make sure that you have ``circup`` installed in your Python environment.
Install it with the following command if necessary:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install circup

With ``circup`` installed and your CircuitPython device connected use the
following command to install:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup install i2c_button

Or the following command to update an existing version:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup update

Usage Example
=============

.. code-block:: python

    import board
    import busio
    from i2c_button import I2C_Button

    i2c = board.I2C()
    button = I2C_Button(i2c)
    print('firmware version is', button.version)

See examples/i2c_button_simpletest.py and other scripts in that folder
for more extensive examples.
