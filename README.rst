CircuitPython I2C Button Ã  la Sparkfun Qwiic Button/Switch/Arcade


Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_.

Installing from PyPI
=====================

On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/circuitpython-i2c-button/>`_. To install for current user:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install circuitpython-i2c-button

To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo pip3 install circuitpython-i2c-button

To install in a virtual environment in your current project:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir project-name && cd project-name
    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip3 install circuitpython-i2c-button

Usage Example
=============

.. code-block:: python

    import board
    import busio
    from i2c_button import I2C_Button
    i2c = busio.I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA)
    button = I2C_Button(i2c)
    print('firmware version is', button.version)

See examples/i2c_button_simpletest.py for a more extensive example.
